// This JS file exists only to call bootstrap jQuery code, as needed. It is currently not strictly required, as the collapsible-desig was removed in an earlier version but
// as it is already linked in base.html and I intend to include more JS features post-submission, I have elected to submit it in its current state.

$(document).ready(function () {
  $(".collapse").collapse();
});
