# "Bugbears & Bailiffs" - A D&D Fifth Edition Character Vault

The Dungeons and Dragons web-community has been on a massive expansion over the past few years, with playgroups both livestreaming their sessions, releasing episodic content online in the forms of podcasts and vlogs, extensive work from the publisher Wizard's of the Coast to engage fans in dialogue to discuss potential rules-changes and rule-expansions. Sites such as DnDbeyond and roll20.net provide rules and in the latter case full experiences in playing games online.

This Flask web-app is designed to be accessed by subsections of this audience, to provide a secure way of storing character-sheet data online and to access it for quick "checks" (Â´Dice-throws). More broadly, the app was a way for me to experiment with noSQL, login-auth systems, JWT-token based timed password retrieval, server-side formhandling and a variety of other standard features that should be present and available in a modern web-app.

The project uses several flask-extensions, as the Flask eco-system to a large degrees suffers from a touch too much overconnectedness there's a lot of content in
requirements.txt - All entries will be detailed at the bottom under the "Technologies used" section.
